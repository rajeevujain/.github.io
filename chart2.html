    <h1>Life Expectancy at Birth for Female</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="MainContent">
    <p>Over the past century women have been living longer. In 1984, average woman's life expectancy for world population was 66. Today, women on average live to 75 - and that number continues to rise. Living longer means more women are at risk for chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. But, there's good news, too. Women are living longer because of preventive measures and new, better treatments for diseases, according to a recent CDC report. A large majority of this prevention and improved treatment results from federally funded research from agencies such as NIH, CDC, AHRQ, and SAMHSA.</p>

<p>Life expectancy for women also varies across regions and income levels of countries. For instance, life expectancy for women is more than 80 years in at least 35 countries. In the WHO African Region, it was estimated at only 54 years and in some countries, particularly in East and Southern Africa, the lack of improvement in life expectancy is mainly due to HIV/AIDS and maternal mortality.
Women tend to have lower rates of mortality at all age. Women’s longevity advantage becomes most apparent in old age. This may be the result of lower lifetime risk behaviors such as smoking and alcohol use. Alternatively, it may be the effect of harder-to-identify biological advantages that result in relatively lower rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer in women.

    <p><u><b>World Development Indicator Information</b></u></p>
    <p><b>Indicator Name:</b> Life expectancy at birth (years)</p>
    <p><b>Indicator Definition:</b> Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.</p>
    <p><b>Aggregation Method:</b> Weighted average</p>
    <p><b>Development Relevance:</b> Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, and adults) and overall mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.</p>
    <p><b>Statistical Concept and Methodology:</b> Life expectancy at birth used here is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of its birth remain constant in the future. It reflects the overall mortality level of a population, and summarizes the mortality pattern that prevails across all age groups in a given year. It is calculated in a period life table which provides a snapshot of a population's mortality pattern at a given time. It therefore does not reflect the mortality pattern that a person actually experiences during his/her life, which can be calculated in a cohort life table. High mortality in young age groups significantly lowers the life expectancy at birth. But if a person survives his/her childhood of high mortality, he/she may live much longer. For example, in a population with a life expectancy at birth of 50, there may be few people dying at age 50. The life expectancy at birth may be low due to the high childhood mortality so that once a person survives his/her childhood, he/she may live much longer than 50 years.</p>
