    <h1>Life Expectancy at Birth for Female</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="MainContent">
    <p>Over the past century women have been living longer. In 1984, average woman's life expectancy for world population was 66. Today, women on average live to 75, and that number continues to rise. Living longer means more women are at risk for chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, and alzheimer's disease. But, there's good news, too. Women are living longer because of preventive measures and new, better treatments for diseases, according to a recent CDC report. A large majority of this prevention and improved treatment results from federally funded research from agencies such as NIH, CDC, AHRQ, and SAMHSA.</p>

<p>Life expectancy for women also varies across regions and income levels of countries. For instance, life expectancy for women is more than 80 years in at least 35 countries. In the WHO African Region, it was estimated at only 54 years and in some countries, particularly in East and Southern Africa, the lack of improvement in life expectancy is mainly due to HIV/AIDS and maternal mortality.
Women tend to have lower rates of mortality at all age. Womenâ€™s longevity advantage becomes most apparent in old age. This may be the result of lower lifetime risk behaviors such as smoking and alcohol use. Alternatively, it may be the effect of harder-to-identify biological advantages that result in relatively lower rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer in women.
