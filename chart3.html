    <h1>Life Expectancy at Birth for Male</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="MainContent">
  <p>Over the past century men’s have been living longer. In 1984, average men’s life expectancy for world population was 62. Today, men on average live to 70, and that number continues to rise. But men’s life expectancy is less then women. There are many reasons why the ratio of men to women (which is roughly equal in young adulthood) starts to favor women over time. </p>
<p> Among the most powerful factors? <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <span>&#8226;    </span>Men tend to take bigger risks <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Have more dangerous jobs <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Die of heart disease more often and at a younger age <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Be larger than women in size <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Commit suicide more often than women <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Be less socially connected <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Avoid doctors
