    <h1>Life Expectancy at Birth for Male</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="MainContent">
  <p>Over the past century men’s have been living longer. In 1984, average men’s life expectancy for world population was 62. Today, men on average live to 70 - and that number continues to rise. But men’s life expectancy is less then women. There are many reasons why the ratio of men to women (which is roughly equal in young adulthood) starts to favor women over time. </p>
<p> Among the most powerful factors? <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <span>&#8226;    </span>Men tend to take bigger risks <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Have more dangerous jobs <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Die of heart disease more often and at a younger age <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Be larger than women in size <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Commit suicide more often than women <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Be less socially connected <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&#8226;    </span>Avoid doctors

    <p><u><b>World Development Indicator Information</b></u></p>
    <p><b>Indicator Name:</b> Life expectancy at birth (years)</p>
    <p><b>Indicator Definition:</b> Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.</p>
    <p><b>Aggregation Method:</b> Weighted average</p>
    <p><b>Development Relevance:</b> Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, and adults) and overall mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.</p>
    <p><b>Statistical Concept and Methodology:</b> Life expectancy at birth used here is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of its birth remain constant in the future. It reflects the overall mortality level of a population, and summarizes the mortality pattern that prevails across all age groups in a given year. It is calculated in a period life table which provides a snapshot of a population's mortality pattern at a given time. It therefore does not reflect the mortality pattern that a person actually experiences during his/her life, which can be calculated in a cohort life table. High mortality in young age groups significantly lowers the life expectancy at birth. But if a person survives his/her childhood of high mortality, he/she may live much longer. For example, in a population with a life expectancy at birth of 50, there may be few people dying at age 50. The life expectancy at birth may be low due to the high childhood mortality so that once a person survives his/her childhood, he/she may live much longer than 50 years.</p>
