    <p>In the early 19th century, life expectancy started to increase in the early industrialized countries while it stayed low in the rest of the world. This led to a very high inequality in how health was distributed across the world. Good health in the rich countries and persistently bad health in those countries that remained poor. Over the last decades this global inequality decreased. No country in the world has a lower life expectancy than the countries with the highest life expectancy in 1800. Many countries that not long ago were suffering from bad health are catching up rapidly. The inequality of life expectancy is still very large across and within countries.Â In 2018 the country with the lowest life expectancy is the Central African Republic with 53 years, in Hong Kong life expectancy is 32 years longer.</p>
<p>Life expectancy is a measure of premature death and it shows large differences in health across the world.
The population of many of the richest countries in the world have life expectancies of over 80 years. In 2018 the life expectancy in Spain, Switzerland, Italy, and Japan was over 83 years. In Hong Kong it was the highest with close to 85 years.
In the countries with the worst health life expectancy is between 50 and 60 years. The population of the Central African Republic has the lowest life expectancy in 2018 with 53 years.</p>
